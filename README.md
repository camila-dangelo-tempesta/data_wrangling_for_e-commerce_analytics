## Exploratory Analysis and Data Wrangling For E-Commerce Analytics

An international e-commerce (E-commerce) company that sells products electronics wants to discover important information from its customer database.
The products are stored in a warehouse at the company's headquarters. After completing the purchases on the company's website, the customer receives the product at home, anywhere in the world.

Products are shipped by Ship, Airplane or Truck, depending on the region of delivery.
On each purchase the customer can receive a discount depending on the weight of the product bought. 

Each customer can make calls to the company's support in case of questions or problems and after receiving the product the customer can leave a review about the experience of purchase.
The only personal data about the customer that is available is gender.
