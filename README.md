# **EDA and Data Wrangling for E-Commerce Analytics**

## Exploratory Analysis and Data Wrangling For E-Commerce Analytics

An international e-commerce (E-commerce) company that sells products electronics wants to discover important information from its customer database.
The products are stored in a warehouse at the company's headquarters. After completing the purchases on the company's website, the customer receives the product at home, anywhere in the world.

Products are shipped by Ship, Airplane or Truck, depending on the region of delivery.
On each purchase the customer can receive a discount depending on the weight of the product bought. 

Each customer can make calls to the company's support in case of questions or problems and after receiving the product the customer can leave a review about the experience of purchase.
The only personal data about the customer that is available is gender.

## 1. BUSINESS PROBLEMS

Our objective working with this project is to explore the data, understand how they are organized, detect possible problems and analyze the data from different perspectives.
We will work with fictitious data that represents real data from an ECommerce company.

## 2. BUSINESS ASSUMPTIONS

The project was divided into two parts:

 * **Part 1**:  Exploratory Analysis brings the technical details with analysis statistics, data visualization, interpretation of graphs and tables, univariate analysis and bivariate and completion report.

 * **Part 2**: The focus is on Exploratory Analysis to answer business questions, where the data is manipulated through Data Wrangling with Pandas and analyzed by different perspectives.
