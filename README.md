# **EDA and Data Wrangling for E-Commerce Analytics**

## Exploratory Analysis and Data Wrangling For E-Commerce Analytics

An international electronic commerce (E-commerce) company that sells electronic products wants to discover important information from its customer database.

At the company's headquarters, the products are stored in a warehouse. After completing the purchase on the company's website, the customer receives the product at home, anywhere in the world. Products are shipped by Ship, Airplane or Truck, depending on the delivery region. On each purchase the customer can receive a discount depending on the weight of the product purchased.

Each customer can make calls to the company's support in case of questions or problems and after receiving the product the customer can leave a comment about the shopping experience. The only personal data available about the customer is gender.

## 1. BUSINESS PROBLEMS

Our goal in working with this project is to explore the data, understand how it is organized, detect potential problems, and analyze the data from different perspectives.

After the EDA, we perform an attribute engineering. Where the objective will be created variables (new features) that us
help to understand the data in a more simplified way and from different perspectives.

We will work with dummy data that represents real data from an e-commerce company.

## 2. BUSINESS ASSUMPTIONS

The project was divided into four parts:

 * **Part 1**:  Exploratory Analysis brings the technical details with analysis statistics, data visualization, interpretation of graphs and tables, univariate analysis and bivariate and completion report.

 * **Part 2**: The focus is on Exploratory Analysis to answer business questions, where the data is manipulated through Data Wrangling with Pandas and analyzed by different perspectives.
 
 * **Part 3**: Attribute Engineering
 
  * **Part 4**: Pre-processing
